# Wack A Mole <br>
Is is a simple wack a mole game that I have developed in javascript, HTML and css. <br>
In this game I have used Following javaScript functions <br>
1.<br>
````javascript
 square.forEach(className => {
     ....
     //for iterating through the element square
 }
```` 
<br>
2.<br>
````javascript
 setInterval(method,1000);
 //1000 is the interval in ms after which the method() will be executed
 //It can also be written as
 setInterval(()=>{
     //anything that you want to do after every 1000 ms or 1s interval
 },1000);
 //the ()=>{} is equivalent to 
 
 function functionName(){
     ....
 }
 //()=>{} is called ES6 arrow function
````
3.<br>
````javascript
 id.addEventListener('mouseup',()=>{
     ....
     //event listener when mouse is clicked on element id
 })
````
